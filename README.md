Offices need a smart application to organize the clients turn.
Clients need also a way to get notified, on their smartphones, when their turn comes.

# How to build

# How to test
After a succeful build
```
cd build 
./TicketControl
```
On another terminal
```
cd build 
./client
```
Now the client is waiting for input:
give ```val1458``` for example means that window 1 has number 458
